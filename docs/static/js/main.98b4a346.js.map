Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(16);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(23);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(14);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t  this.writeencoding = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\t\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  if (options) {\n\t    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n\t    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n\t      done(stream, er, data);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
